            </strong>
            Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
            introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function
            expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow
            functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences
            between them.

            It is Now, it boils down to this question: how should you decide
            whether to use the map or forEach method? If you’re planning to
            alter the array elements by applying a function, you should use the
            map method, since it doesn’t modify the original array and returns a
            new array. In this way, the original array is kept intact. On the
            other hand, if you want to loop through all the elements of an array
            and don’t need a returned array, use the forEach method.
            <strong>What is the difference between find() and filter() </strong>
            The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the
            selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing
            through the root to leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all
            the elements and returns the element that matches and the element
            that do not match are removed.
